<h1>The Grammys 2025: surprises, snubs? tea and more</h1>

<p> Including playlsits as a form of interactive media allows the actual viewer to judge for themselves, in this case, which album is better and which one deserved album of the year. It makes the music much more accessible for the viewer, instead of making them go to a different app to find the album, playlist, etc. Overall, it was very easy to embedd the different playlists onto my webpage. Out of the other tools I used in this story, I would say that this one was the easiest. </p>
<h2> 2025 Grammys raise millions for LA fire relief</h2>
<p> Alongside being the biggest music event of the year,this years Grammys generated over $7 million for LA fire relief</p>
<p> Below is a photo of Altadena, one of the main victims of the LA fires, before and after the Eaton fire</p>

<p>I had a fairly easy time using this tool. The directions were straight forward, which I appreciated. I think the hardest part was finding the best pictures to use to get my point across in the most effective way. I believe that this fits my story because it visualizes the magnitude of the damage done by the Altadena fire. In general, adding imagery that visualizes the extent of change can help readers understand the content of the story more.</p>
<h2> Kendrick Llamar wins 5 Grammys for his hit diss record "Not Like Us"</h2>
<p> Kendrick Llamar had the whole crowd singing <span class="soundcite" data-id="1816838535" data-start="66462" data-end="73719" data-plays="1">"tryna strike a chord and it's prolly a-minorrrrr"</span> at this years Grammys. The star rapper won a staggering 5 Grammy awards for the diss track. </p>
<p> I used knightlab's "soundcite" tool to create a soundbite of Kendrick Llamar's "Not Like Us." The tool itself was pretty easy to use which I appreaciated, and the directions were straight forward. I think soundcite is a useful tool because it allows the reader to have an audio of what is being mentioned or what is going on in the story. In my case, I think it allows the reader to hear that hit line and better understand why that particular line is famous. </p>
